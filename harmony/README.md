# HarmonyOS App

This directory contains the HarmonyOS HAP project copied into this repo so it can be modified and built without touching the source project under `C:\Users\mu\Desktop\code\security_tool`.

Current milestone:

- Build a normal-permission HAP first.
- Keep `mstsc` / `wfreerdp.exe` out of the HarmonyOS runtime path.
- Add the RDP ArkUI and N-API work after the HAP build path is stable.

## Build and install with MCP

Use the HarmonyOS MCP service for normal development:

- `build_app` with project path `harmony/app`
- `install_app` with the generated HAP path

The project-level `build-profile.json5` already contains the normal-app signing configuration. Do not run a separate signing script.

## Local build fallback

```powershell
.\harmony\app\build_hap.bat
```

Local HAP outputs are ignored by git.
