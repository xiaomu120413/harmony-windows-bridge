# HarmonyOS App

This directory contains the HarmonyOS HAP project copied into this repo so it can be modified and built without touching the source project under `C:\Users\mu\Desktop\code\security_tool`.

Current milestone:

- Build a normal-permission HAP first.
- Keep `mstsc` / `wfreerdp.exe` out of the HarmonyOS runtime path.
- ArkTS calls into the C++ N-API bridge through `libentry.so`.
- Native `probe()`, `connect(params)`, and `disconnect()` are available.
- `probe()` dynamically loads the local FreeRDP probe library when runtime `.so` files have been synced from `harmony/out/`.
- Real RDP connect/auth is still pending M4.

## Native bridge

The entry module builds a native shared library from `entry/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.

Current exported calls:

- `probe()` returns bridge version, ABI, FreeRDP, WinPR, and OpenSSL probe status.
- `connect(params)` validates the basic connection fields and returns native logs.
- `disconnect()` returns a native disconnect result.

The signed HAP currently packages `libentry.so` for `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64`.

Sync local FreeRDP runtime libraries before building the HAP with FreeRDP probe support:

```powershell
.\harmony\scripts\windows\sync-freerdp-runtime.ps1
```

The synced runtime libraries under `entry/libs/` are local build outputs and are ignored by git.

## Build and install with MCP

Use the HarmonyOS MCP service for normal development:

- `build_app` with project path `harmony/app`
- `install_app` with the generated HAP path

The project-level `build-profile.json5` already contains the normal-app signing configuration. Do not run a separate signing script.

## Local build fallback

```powershell
.\harmony\app\build_hap.bat
```

Local HAP outputs are ignored by git.
